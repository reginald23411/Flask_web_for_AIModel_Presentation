            <h3>(a) Confusion matrix</h3>
            <p>We used python to generate a confusion matrix. The following shows the confusion matrix, which is generated by python function.</p>

            <h3>(b) Normalized change on the debut of careers</h3>
            <p>The following shows the normalized change on the debut of careers for people with the best, second-best, third-best, and fourth-best predicted performance.</p>

            <h3>(c) Discussion of results</h3>
            <p>Regarding the prediction model, the accuracy is 1, which indicates that the model is fairly accurate. The sensitivity (true positive rate) is 1, suggesting that the model performs well in predicting careers for people with the right profession.</p>

            <h2>Roadmap for S1-S3 Development and Deployment</h2>

            <h3>S1: Data Collection, Cleaning, Modeling, and Classification</h3>
            <p>Using the knowledge learned in the S1 application class, we created a model in R that can be used for simple data collection, cleaning, modeling, and classification of job advertisements. We presented the project to the teacher for evaluation and feedback, which will guide us in making improvements to the model.</p>

            <h3>S2: Improvement and Optimization</h3>
            <p>In S2, we utilized the knowledge learned in class to improve and optimize our model. Our goal was to enhance accuracy, improve analytical capabilities, and further refine the data collection, cleaning, modeling, and classification of job advertisements. We presented the optimized model to the project teacher for evaluation and incorporated their feedback to make the model more accurate and effective.</p>

            <h3>S3: Final Product Submission and Evaluation</h3>
            <p>In S3, we finalized the product and prepared the final report. We publicly displayed and presented the final product to the audience, allowing them to evaluate the suitability of our model for their needs and compare it with existing models. Finally, we conducted a self-evaluation of our work and performance, reflecting on the lessons learned throughout the project.</p>
